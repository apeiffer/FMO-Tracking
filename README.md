## Installation Notes
* The RVOS subfolder is just the existing RVOS code we have cloned - it is there so we can synchronize the files that are needed in the `RVOS_FMO.ipynb` Colab notebook. This is necessary because Google Colab is mounted on each of our own Google Drives, so the files used by the notebook have to be on each of our accounts if we want to run the notebook.
* As such, the RVOS subfolder must be placed in a directory located at `My Drive/Colab Notebooks/CS2770_CV/Project` in each of our Google Drive workspaces.
